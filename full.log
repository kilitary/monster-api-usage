The FCC has approved a waiver of 1575 MHz spectrum to allow for "public safety and safety communications purposes" (including 1.0 W GPS L1 and Glonass L1) to be used in 1620-1640 MHz frequency band. The waiver is for a 2 GHz bandwidth, 1 GHz in the 1585-1645 MHz band, but not a 2 GHz frequency in the 1675-1712 MHz band, which is currently used by some GPS L1 applications.
The waiver expires on 6th January 2002, 2 years and 6 months from its initial issuance in July 2001.
The waiver is granted to "all applicants whose applications were received by the Commission by 5PM of 5th July 2001" (see the list of companies here).
The FCC will be accepting additional applications for a 2 GHz frequency band waiver for "public safety and safety communications purposes" after 6 months, and will then evaluate each application individually.
This waiver is the latest in a series of FCC decisions that have allowed some GPS L1 applications to be used on the spectrum in the 1.0 GHz band.

 +Galileo L1B?
There are several criminal activities that can be conducted with a device that can access the 1450MHz 1.0W 5G+ GPS L1 + Glonass L1 + Galileo L1B bands. These bands are used for various purposes like GPS tracking, communication, and surveillance. Some criminals may use these bands for criminal activities such as hacking, jamming, and interfering with emergency services, which could disrupt normal traffic and cause accidents. The potential for criminal activities on these bands should always be taken into consideration when using any device that can access these frequencies.
